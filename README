1. How to set up environment?
    To run this program you have to install OpenImageIO first. This library will read image data for us.
    To install OpenImageIO in your system. It may need other image library.
    You could find instruction and source file here:
        https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio
    After you install the OpenImageIO, you may find:
        ($INSTALL_PATH)/oiio-RB-1.0/dist/linux/include/OpenImageIO
        ($INSTALL_PATH)/oiio-RB-1.0/dist/linux/lib        
    You need to change image.h line 5 
        #include <OpenImageIO/imageio.h> 
        to your correct path. And correct the INCLUDES_PATH in MakeFile.
    You also need to add 
        ($INSTALL_PATH)/oiio-RB-1.0/dist/linux/lib
        to your lib path or copy one dynamic lib file and two soft link under this folder into your lib directory.
        
2. How to run this project?
    In your console, type
        make
        ./color <your image path>
    Or you could type
	./color --help
    for more information.
    It may take 5-10s, then you can find "output.jpg" in your folder.
    
3. What's the big O?
    Well, our first version code use lots of C and some C++. The big O is depends on the input... Yes, you hear me. It depends.
    In this version, I improve algorithm and change to OO program. Now it is a C++ code completely. And I guarantee the big O = NLogN.
    N equals the pixle number in your image (width * height).

4. Test cases
    1jpg-12.jpg are all come from Berkeley database.
